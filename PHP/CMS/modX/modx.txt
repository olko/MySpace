[	chunks for template creating	]

	  * [(site_url)] - A “setting” which takes the URL as determined during the MODx
	  			 installation and inserts it in the html at run-time.
    * [*pagetitle*] - A “Template Variable” which takes the page title as 
    			 entered in the “document setting” screen of the Manager, and inserts 
    			 it in the html at run-time.
    * [(site_name)] - A “setting” which takes the site name as determined during
    			 the MODx installation and inserts it in the html at run-time.
    * [(base_url)] - A “setting” which is based on the URL as determined during 
    			 the MODx installation and inserts it in the html at run-time.
    * [!Wayfinder? &startId=`0` &level=`1`!] - Explained above.
    * [*content*] - A “Template Variable” which enables a rich text editor 
    				(TinyMCE or FCKEditor) to allow the entry of content to the document (page). 
    				Content can be a wide combination of text, html markup, images, 
    				various media, etc. (See- I told you I'd tell you all about adding "content".)
    * [!Wayfinder? &startId=`0`!] - Wayfinder is a snippet which builds a menu 
    				for the website navigation as described above.
    * {{cixfooter}} - This is a chunk, which inserts pre-formatted text and html
    				markup into the page at it's location.
