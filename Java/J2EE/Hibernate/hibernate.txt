// The Hibernate-Specific Properties
	-	hibernate.archive.autodetection Informs Hibernate how to discover the classes that are

	file style is being 	used.
	-	hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto Determines whether Hibernate will issue DDL commands
	to the database server to manage data structures. The values can be validateâ€”the 
	structures are only validated; 
	-	hibernate.format_sql Formats the SQL being logged into a format that is easier to
	read.
